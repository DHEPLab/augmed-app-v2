# The AugMed App (Frontend)

AugMed is a web application, built for the UNC-Chapel Hill DHEP Lab, that allows the lab to collect data from participants in a user-friendly way. The app is designed to be used on any devices, and it allows participants to answer questions about their judgements for cases with potential Colorectal Cancer (CRC). The app is built using React, and the backend API is built using Flask and Python.

> [!NOTE]
> **Backend Repository**: **[DHEP Lab AugMed Backend](https://github.com/DHEPLab/augmed-api).**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a working installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later).
- You have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) installed, which comes with Node.js.
- You have access to the DHEP Lab's API and the necessary credentials to connect to it.
- You have a code editor installed (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- You have a web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- You have a tablet or device for testing the app, if applicable.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd AugMed-app
    ```
   
3. **Install dependencies**:

    Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment

The app is deployed using AWS services. The deployment process involves the following steps:

1. **Build the app**: Run `npm run build` to create a production build of the app. This is automatically done in the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
2. **Push the build to AWS S3**: The build files are uploaded to an S3 bucket for hosting.
3. **Deploy the app using AWS ECS**: The app is deployed to an ECS cluster using a Docker container.
4. **Configure the load balancer**: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is set up to route traffic to the ECS service.
5. **Set up DNS**: The domain name is configured to point to the ALB.
6. **Monitor the deployment**: The deployment is monitored to ensure that the app is running smoothly.
7. **Update the app**: When updates are made to the app, the deployment process is repeated to push the changes to production.

It also uses Terraform to manage the infrastructure as code.
